First Wordpress portfolio made with a simple Astra theme for the sections structure and at the end designed by myself, plus added some features with CSS for a logo transition between pages, PHP for a simple validation and some Jquery for a back-to-top button located in the bottom right corner. 

==========================================================================================================================================================


#Quick summary:


1. Took a Wordpress basic Astra theme where at the end I changed every single design (I did not like a thing, lol, had to do almost everything myself).

2. Added some basic animations for a first page title transitions and some motion effects for the titles in each section.

3.Used a WP plugin, you can find at https://wordpress.org/plugins/code-snippets/, to edit a php file, add a validation and create a page transition with a dev logo(Sometimes is glitchy on mobile devices, still need to adapt that media query).

4. Afterwards, I wanted to add a back to top button (That tiny arrow located on the bottom right corner that takes you back to the start once you reach the end of the page) but I realized that the code snippet plugin was limited to one code file at a time (Not a good practice if you ask me), therefore I did edit the functions.php file (Please make a child theme if you're not sure, to have a backup) to write a enqueue php code in order to create an external JS file to add Jquery code. That way I was able to add Js and Jquery to my website and some css to load the icon and resize it depending on the device (Responsive stuff made by my own). By the way, for the css I went to wordpress customize ==>  additional css ==> wrote the code inside that block and saved it.

#Additionally notes:

Last but not least, I've uploaded the webpage on github pages to showoff my git skills and to not pay a single penny.

The page is under develepment, the "Projects" page is empty as my soul, once I get more projects I'll upload them on that side.

Additonally, regarding design and features I'm planning on improve all of that aswell, no worries , this is just a newbie project, is not the end.
