# WordPress Porfolio

First Wordpress portfolio made with a simple simple Astra Theme, Elementor and my own creativity on the Front-End, plus added some features with CSS for a logo transition between pages, PHP for a simple validation and some Jquery for a back-to-top button located in the bottom right corner.

# Quick summary


* Took a Wordpress basic Astra theme for the basic structure and used Elementor Pro and a good use of creativity to change the front-end
* Added some basic animations for a first page title transitions and some motion effects for the titles and imaged in each section.
* Used a plugin to edit a few pieces of code , you can find as ["Code Snippets"](https://wordpress.org/plugins/code-snippets/)
* With the prior plugin added some php to validate the transition between pages
* Added a back-to-top button with an arrow icon from [Flati.com ](https://www.flaticon.com/free-icons/best)


## The back-to-top arrow
I wanted to add a back to top button (That tiny arrow located on the bottom right corner that takes you back to the start once you reach the end of the page) but I realized that the code snippet plugin was limited to one code file at a time (Not a good practice if you ask me), therefore I did edit the functions.php file (Please make a child theme if you're not sure, to have a backup) to write a enqueue php code in order to create an external JS file to add Jquery code. That way I was able to add Js and Jquery to my website and some css to load the icon and resize it depending on the device (Responsive stuff made by my own). By the way, for the css I went to wordpress  > customize ==>  additional css ==> wrote the code inside that block and saved it.


# Additional Notes

* Is just a strarter project in order to practice my WordPress skills with Elementor and a good use of JQuery & PHP.
* Now I have projects available on the "Projects" section but this is not my up-to date porfolio website
